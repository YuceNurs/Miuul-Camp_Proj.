Calculating Potential Customer Returns with Rule-Based Classification

Problem :
A gaming company aims to create level-based new customer profiles using some characteristics of its customers, and based on these new customer profiles, it wants to create segments and predict how much potential new customers coming to these segments can generate in terms of average revenue for the company.
For example, the gaming company wants to determine how much an average 25-year-old male user from Turkey, who uses iOS, can potentially generate in terms of revenue.

Dataset Story

The data set "persona.csv" contains the prices of products sold by an international gaming company and includes some demographic information about the users who purchased these products. The data set is composed of records created for each sales transaction. The table is not deduplicated, meaning that a user with specific demographic characteristics may have made multiple purchases.
